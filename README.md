    <h3>Angel Script Runtime Environment</h3>
</div>

## About
Mavi.as is a fully featured memory efficient Angel Script environment similar to Node.js.

## Usage
Simplest examples:
```bash
# Show all commands:
    vi -h
    vi --help
#Execute a script file:
    vi -f [path] [args]
#Debug a script file:
    vi -d -f [path] [args]
#Run in interactive mode:
    vi
    vi -i
```
Also note: -option and --option both have different syntax:
```bash
# Shorthand style
    vi -option [value]
# Normal style
    vi --option=[value]
```

## Preprocessor
Scripts support preprocessor that can be used just like C++ preprocessor for dependency management. Preprocessed script lines of code could get shuffled around, however if compile or runtime error happens you will get last N lines of source code where it happend (including column pointer).
```cpp
// Global include search (built-in addons, can be disabled)
#include <std/console.as> // Standard library include
#include <std/console> // Shorter version

// Local include search (any script file, can be disabled)
#include "file" // Short include version
#include "file.as" // Will include file at current directory
#include "./file.as" // Same but more verbose
#include "./../file.as" // Will include file from parent directory
#include "../file.as" // Same but less verbose

// Global or local addon search (C++ addons, can be disabled)
#include <addon.so> // Linux SO (global search will be used)
#include <addon.dylib> // Mac SO
#include <addon.dll> // Windows SO
#include <addon> // Or automatic search

// Remote includes (local only syntax, can be disabled)
// A file from remote server
#include "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romanpunia/mavi.as/main/bin/examples/utils/win32.as"

// Remote addon includes (local only syntax, can be disabled)
// This will clone a git repo and if it is a native repo build it then link with runtime as shared library
// If repo is vm based (meaning no native code) then index file will be used
// Directory that includes this remote addon will get subdirectory <addons> with simple caching system
// Addon must contain <addon.json> configuration file (which is simple and can be generated by Mavi.as automatically: --init)
#include "@romanpunia/test.as"
```

Scripts are written using Angel Script syntax as usual. Standard library defers from default provided addons at angelcode. Entrypoint is defined by either _\<int main()\>_ or _\<int main(string[]@)\>_ function signatures.
```cpp
#include <std/string.as> // By default string class is not exposed

int main() { return 0; }
int main(string[]@ args) { return 0; }
```

Macros are also supported.
```cpp
#define SUM(a, b) ((a) + (b))

int main()
{
#ifdef SUM
    return SUM(1, 2);
#else
    return 0;
#endif
}
```

Preprocessor also supports shared object imports. They are not considered addons or plugins in any way. They can be used to implement some low level functionality without accessing C++ code. More on that in **bin/examples/utils/win32.as**.
```cpp
#pragma cimport("kernel32.dll", "GetCurrentProcessId", "uint32 win32_get_pid()") // SO filename or path, function name to find in SO, function definition to expose to Angel Script.

int main()
{
#ifdef SOF_GetCurrentProcessId // SOF = shared object function, SOF_* will be defined if function has successfully been exposed
    return win32_get_pid();
#else
    return 0;
#endif
}
```

## Addons (local and remote)
There is support for addons. Addons must be compiled with Mavi as a shared object dependency or they must load Mavi symbols manually to work properly. Addon is a C++ shared library that implements following methods:
```cpp
#include <mavi/core/scripting.h>

extern "C" { VI_EXPOSE int ViInitialize(Mavi::Scripting::VirtualMachine*); }
int ViInitialize(Mavi::Scripting::VirtualMachine* VM) // Required initialization for requested virtual machine
{
    return 0; // Zero is successful initialization
}

extern "C" { VI_EXPOSE void ViUninitialize(Mavi::Scripting::VirtualMachine*); }
void ViUninitialize(Mavi::Scripting::VirtualMachine* VM) // Optional deinitialization for requested virtual machine
{
}
```
You can create your own addon using _--init_ or _-init_ command. This will create either a new native addon or vm addon template in specified directory, don't forget to name it using _--name_ or _-n_ command.

After that you will either have a ready to use git repository with CMake configuration for C++ project with example code above. Or you will get two files _addon.json_ and _addon.as_. Keep in mind that without having _addon.json_ repository won't be evaluated as addon. Generated repository can be pushed to github and used afterwards with:
```cpp
/* Points to: https://github.com/repo_owner/repo_name */
#include "@repo_owner/repo_name" // Must start with <@> symbol
```

Keep in mind that if you use remote addons which is a feature that works similiar to NPM, you will get \<addons\> directory near you executable script that is basically \<node_modules\> directory. First time builds (if native) are slow as it is required to download full Mavi framework beforehand and build the target addon using platform compiler, after shared library has been built loading times are submillisecond.

* Native addons are made using C++. They must be compiled before first usage.
* VM addons are made using AngelScript. Compilation is just in time.

__This feature is considered experimental as it suffers of not fast enough build times for native addons and might confuse files in local repository of addons.__

## Debugging
You may just run mavi with _--debug_ or _-d_ flag. This will allocate resources for debugger context and before executing anything it will debug-stop. Type _help_ to view available commands.

## Performance
Although AngelScript is pretty fast out of the box (default tuned about 2-6x faster python3), if code being executed is CPU intensive and lies within VM then it might be useful to run it using JIT compiler. This compiler is pretty old, somewhat unstable and does not support ARM platform, it can actually work only on Windows and Linux. Nevertheless, it's still pretty powerful and can increase performance by 4 orders of magnitude. Add _--jit_ option to enable it.

Currently, the main issue is initialization time. About 40ms (app-mode) or 210ms (game-mode) of time is taken by initialization that does not include script source code compilation or execution. However it does not mean this time will grow as dramatically as Node.js initialization time when loading many CommonJS modules.

You may also check performance and memory comparisons in **bin/examples/cpu/test.\***. There are 6 scripts: 2 for each runtime (Mavi.as, Node.js, Python3). First is singlethreaded mode, second is multithreaded/multiprocessed mode. You may run these scripts with a single argument that will be a number higher than zero (usually pretty big number). This example will calculate some 64-bit integer hash based on input. One of the consequences of multiprocessing is high memory usage that will be impactful on multicore CPUs. Also this example can be highly JIT optimized.

## Memory usage
Generally, AngelScript uses much less memory than v8 JavaScript runtime. That is because there are practically no wrappers between C++ types and AngelScript types. However, JIT compiler may increase memory usage as well as source code preserving in memory.

## Binary generation and packaging
Mavi.as supports a feature that allows one to build the executable from AngelScript program.
1. To use this feature you must have Git and CMake installed.
2. Template repository will be downloaded, CMake configuration and source code will be generated.
3. CMake configuration and build will be executed.
```bash
# Build an example program (cwd is mavi.as/bin/examples), you may run it multiple times (minimal rebuilds are enabled)
    vi -n console -o . -f console
```

This will produce a binary and shared libraries. Amount of shared libraries produced will depend on \<#include\> statements inside your script. For example, you won't be needing OpenAL shared library if you don't use **std/audio**. Project will have _.template_ files which are unmodified versions of original files near them.

AngelScript VM will be configured according to your Mavi.as setup. For example, if you use JIT then built binary will use it. Your AngelScript source code will be compiled to platform-independant bytecode. This bytecode will then be hex-encoded and embedded into your binary as executable text.

Generated output will not embed any resources requested by runtime such as images, files, audio and other resources. You will have to add (and optionally pack) them manually as in usual C++ project. **Important note for Windows platform**: by default Mavi.as is built as console application, so the console it self spawns automatically whenever intended by app or not, however output binary is built using subsystem windows, meaning no console without explicit request, this may cause unintended behaviour if you don't use **console::show()** method.

__This feature is considered experimental as it suffers of very slow build times. You may also open generated project or regenerate it manually and open it in your IDE. Runtime code is very minimal as well as output binary size.__

## Other info
You may take a look into __html.as__ example which leverages HTML/CSS + AngelScript powers. This shows how to create memory and CPU efficient GUI applications based on modern graphics API.
